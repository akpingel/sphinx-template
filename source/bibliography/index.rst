Annotated Bibliography
======================

The History of C# topic from Microsoft Contributors [#f1]_ would be a excellent
place to start learning about this language. This source discusses the history
of the significant releases of C#. This article offers insight from multiple
authors about the advantages and disadvantages of using this language from each
release and noted. Using links, the article mentions key parts of C# while
providing additional sources to review if needed.

Information in this text could be useful in showing the changes of this language
while teaching what should be noted about each different phase of releases. I
could pull from this article the important information from each release that
will give me a basic knowledge about coding in C# that will guide me in
beginning my first project.

To learn how to set up a project, a tutorial document about how to get
started can be utilized. The source Tutorial: Create a simple C# console app -
Visual Studio [#f2]_ shows how to start creating a project in C# from the very
beginning. It begins with opening Visual Studio and continues into the
development of a C# console app. I will utilize this source to help me set up
a project correctly and understanding what the beginning prompts mean. There is
specific code within this tutorial that will help me a simple “Hello World”
console application started that I can then expand further.


After getting a starter app created and learning the basics of C#, the book
Mastering C# and .NET Framework [#f3]_ can guide me in learning additional basic
and advanced topics since this source goes more in-depth. It incorporates
information about the backend, including how to connect with a SQL or NoSQL
database. Graphics and example code are utilized to show real examples of what
the text is talking about. Additionally, the author includes advanced topics and
information on security and performance while using the language.

This book is a little dated and only contains information through C# 7.0.
However, it is a great resource to get some starter information that would
advance my application past the primary “Hello World” status. A section in the
preface discusses what each chapter includes to pull specific information for
individual chapters rather than reading the whole book. I would
draw from this book how to advance my code by connecting to a SQL database.

The most recent version of the C# language is the 9.0 release. The article
Introducing C# 9.0 [#f4]_ is beneficial to learn about the new features and how
it relates to the .NET environment. The new features are listed out at the
beginning of the article to inform the reader about what the article contains.
Additionally, throughout the text, there are examples to emphasize the previous
code one would use and follows it with the updated code that can be used because
of the new release. To end, the author includes a summary and an email to be
used for more questions. This article will help emphasize the now part of C# and
why a programmer may want to utilize this language in their work. The code
included in the text will guide me into hands-on learning by incorporating the
code into my IDE and making my program more functional and condensed.


Additionally, to see the new changes of C# 9.0, the video What’s New in C#?
[#f5]_ will be useful to optimize my code. This source discusses C# 9.0 from the
people who took part in creating this release. Mac, a designer, and Dustin, an
engineer of the new release, use this video as an opportunity to show real-time
code and where you can incorporate new features. They show old code (C# 8.0),
and how to update it to be more current and precise. This source is beneficial
because I can watch how they adapt their old version of code into an updated
version. I can utilize their example code and refer to it when coding myself.
Specifically, in C# 9.0, the use of the main function is no longer necessary.
Additionally, the use of records can be utilized to represent values rather
than objects.
