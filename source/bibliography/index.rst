Annotated Bibliography
======================

The History of C# topic from Microsoft Contributors [#f1]_ would be a good place
to start. This source discusses the history of the major releases of C#.
This article offers insight from multiple authors about the advantages and
disadvantages of using this language from each release and what you should
take note of. Using links, the article mentions key parts of C# while providing
additional sources to review if needed.

Information in this text could be useful
in showing the changes of this language while teaching what should be noted
about each different phase of releases. I could pull from this article the
important information from each release that will give me basic knowledge
about coding in C#.

After learning the basics of C#, the book Mastering C# and .NET Framework [#f2]_
can guide me in learning additional basic and advanced topics since this source
goes more in depth. It incorporates information about the backend, including how
to use with a SQL or NoSQL database. Graphics and example code are utilized to
show real examples of what the text is talking about. Additionally, the author
includes advanced topics and information on security and performance while using
the language. This book is a little dated and only contains information through
C# 7.0, however, it is a great resource to get some starter information about
how the language came to be and how it is different than other languages.

There
is also a section in the preface that discusses what each chapter includes so I
could pull specific information for certain chapter rather than reading the
whole book. The information I would pull from this book would be ______.

The most recent version of the C# language is the 9.0 release. The article
Introducing C# 9.0 [#f3]_ is beneficial to learn about the new features and
how it relates to the .NET environment. The new features are listed out at the
beginning of the article so the reader is informed about what they can find in
the rest of the reading. Additionally, there are examples included throughout
the text to emphasize the previous code one would use and follows it with the
updated code that can be used because of the new release. To end, the author
includes a summary and an email to be used for more questions.

This article will be helpful to emphasize the now part of C# and why a
programmer may want to utilize this language in their work. The code included
in the text will be able to guide the reader into hand-on learning by being
able to incorporate the code into their IDE to begin using and practicing with.


Additionally, to see the new changes of the new release of C# 9.0, the video
What’s New in C#? [#f4]_ will be beneficial. This source discusses C# 9.0 from
the people who took part in creating this release. Mac, a designer and Dustin,
an engineer of the new release, use this video as an opportunity to show
real-time code and where you can incorporate new features. They show old code
(C# 8.0), and how to update it to be more current and precise. This source is
beneficial because there are also real-time questions that were being asked
throughout the presentation that the hosts were able to answer. They refer to
resources that you should go look at for more information.

Finally, after learning about the language, a tutorial video about how to get
started can be utilized. The source Tutorial: Create a simple C# console app -
Visual Studio [#f5]_ shows how to start creating a project in C# from the very
beginning. It starts with opening Visual Studio and continues into the
development of a C# console app. I will utilize this source to help me set up
a project correctly and understanding what the beginning prompts mean.
