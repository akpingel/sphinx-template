C# Outline
==========

**Thesis:**
Understanding C# and its history to determine relevance in today's world
compared to other languages.


* Step 1 - Understanding C#

  * Where did C# originate from?

    * Created by Microsoft
    * Developed in 2000 by Anders Hejlsberg at Microsoft as a rival to Java [#f5]_
    * Created because Sun, (eventually bought by Oracle), did not want
      Microsoft to make changes to Java, so Microsoft decided to make it's own
      language instead. [#f5]_

  * QUOTE: "One of the key differences between C# and these other languages,
    particularly Java, is that we tried to stay much closer to C++ in our
    design. C# borrows most of its operators, keywords, and statements directly
    from C++. But beyond these more traditional language issues, one of our key
    design goals was to make the C# language component-oriented, to add to the
    language itself all of the concepts that you need when you write components.
    Concepts such as properties, methods, events, attributes, and documentation
    are all first-class language constructs." (page 54 from creator) [#f6]_

  * C# is strongly, dynamically typed

    * Include graphic from book that compares C# with other languages
      and compares dynamic/static and strong/weak [#f6]_ page 55

  * What is C# used for?

    * Website Development
    * Windows Application
    * Games

* Step 2 - History of C# [#f4]_

  * C# 1.0 [#f4]_
    * Major Features
    * Released with Visual Studio .Net 2002
    * Looked like Java
    * Started as a generic Object-Oriented (OO) Language
  * C# 2.0 [#f6]_

    * Released with Visual Studio 2005
    * Changed the generic OO Language

      * Quote - "C# version 2.0 brought iterators. To put it succinctly,
        iterators let you examine all the items in a List \(or other Enumerable
        types\) with a foreach loop. Having iterators as a first-class part of
        the language dramatically enhanced readability of the language and
        people's ability to reason about the code."  [#f4]_

    * C# still trying to catch up with Java

  * C# 3.0 --> this release included the release of Visual Studio 2008

    * Marked major growth in C#
    * Established C# as a respected programming langauge
    * LINQ
    * QUOTE: "C# 3.0 presented a revolutionary concept. C# 3.0 had begun to lay
      the groundwork for turning C# into a hybrid Object-Oriented / Functional
      language." [#f4]_

    * Could now right SQL-style queries to perform operations
    * Query and lambda expressions

  * C# 4.0

    * Released with Visual Studio 2010
    * Embedded interop types alleviated deployment pain
    * Optional parameters helped avoid method overloads
    * Introduction of the keyword dynamic

  * C# 5.0

    * Released with Visual Studio 2012
    * Async and await for asynchronous programming
    * Caller info attributes

* Step 3 - History of C# Versions 6.0 through 8.0 focused on smaller releases.

  * C# 6.0

    * Released with Visual Studio 2015
    * Moved towards smaller features that made C# more productive
    * This release made code more readable
    * Released Roslyn the compiler as a service

      * C# compiler now written in C# and the compiler can be utilized for
        programming efforts

  * C# 7.0

    * Released with Visual Studio 2017
    * New features with new capabilities that makes code even cleaner
    * .NET Core targets any operating system
    * Condensed the declaration of variables to use with the out keyword by
      allowing multiple return values via tuple

  * C# 7.1 through 7.3

    * 7.1 - async method
    * 7.2 - private protected access modifier, conditional of ref expressions
    * 7.3 - provides new features to support safe code and enhancements

  * C# 8.0

    * First major C# release that specifically targets .NET Core
    * Major Features
    * Default interface members require enhancements in the CLR
    * .NET Core Libraries

* Step 4 - Current Version of C# - 9.0 (references for step 3 [#f8]_ [#f9]_)

  * Date of release
  * What changed? [#f8]_

    * Part of .NET 5 - journey toward a single .NET ecosystem
    * Focus on modern workloads - applications and services being built today
    * Many C# 9.0 features rely on .NET 5.0

      * Focuses on features that support cloud applications, modern
        engineering practices, and more readable code

  * New features

    * Top-level statements - cleans up code [#f9]_

    * Include code sample of the changes [#f8]_


    * Before:

    .. code-block:: python

            using System;
            namespace HelloWorld
            {
                class Program
                {
                    static void Main(string[] args)
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
                    }
                }
            }

        ..

    * After:

    ..

    * Record types -> include sample code
    * Init-only setters -> include sample code
    * Enhancements to pattern matching
    * Function pointers

  * What's new? [#f9]_

    * Non-destructive mutation
    * Objects that are more like values
    * Done with record notion
    * Explain what it means to be a record
    * Show sample code of a person class

* Step 5 - Comparison to Other Languages and Example Applications

  * Java - include sample code to compare Hello World

    .. code-block:: python

        class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
           }
        }

    ..

  * Python - include sample code to compare Hello World

    .. code-block:: python

        print("Hello, World!)

    ..

  * C ++

    .. code-block:: python

        return 0;
        }

    ..

  * C

    .. code-block:: python

        #include <stdio.h>
        int main() {
           // printf() displays the string inside quotation
           printf("Hello, World!");
           return 0;
        }
